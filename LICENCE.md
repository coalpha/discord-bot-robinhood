## You absolute Buffoon.

- YOU think you can challenge me in my own realm?
- YOU think you can rebel against my authority?
- YOU dare come into my house and upturn my dining chairs and spill coffee grounds in my Keurig?
- YOU thought you were safe in your chain mail armor behind that screen of yours.

## Policy:

- I will take these laminate wood floor boards and destroy you.
- I didn’t want war.
- I didn’t start it (war).
